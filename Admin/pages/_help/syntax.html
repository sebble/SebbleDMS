<h1>Sen-sebble Markup Syntax</h1>

<p>Custom markup syntax is used in for some website content.  Multiple configurations exist, below is the basic implementation.</p>

<style>
pre {
  border: solid 1px #999;
  background-color: #fcfcfc;
}
div.preview {
  border: solid 1px #999;
  background-color: #fcfcff;
  padding: 1em;
}
blockquote {
  border: 1px solid #49B;
  padding: 1em;
  background-color: #f6f6ff;
  font-style: italic;
}
</style>

<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>

<h3>Headings &amp; paragraphs</h3>

<pre>
 === Third Level Heading

Paragraphs are automatically created when a blank line is encountered.  You may
have new-lines in your paragraphs and they will be ignored unless immediately 
preceeded by two backwards slashes \\
as shown here.

Multiple paragraphs are easy to make, simply leave a blank line to get a real 
paragraph break.

 ==== Fourth Level Heading

Headings are simply denoted by using an equality-sign as the first non-space 
character.  The number of repeated signs will determine the level of heading 
displayed.

<h3>Block level elements</h3>

<pre>
Sometimes you may wish to use block level elements such as a blockquote:

>>>
  Once upon a time...
>>>

or maybe even some pre-formatted text:

```
  Pre-formatted text may be used for code
as white-space is preserved.
```

As you can see above, these are described by using 3 symbols at the start of a 
line and must be preceeded and followed by a blank line.  For a full list of
elements see your specific configuration.

<h3>Inline formatting &amp; Symbols</h3>

<pre>
Importantly there are also some inline elements that can be useful for 
expressing the true meaning of some words or phrases in your block-level 
paragraphs.

These can be used for ///emphasis///, or giving a phrase a **strong --effect-- 
++emphasis++**.

In addition to these elements some symbols may also be converted for convenience
such as the copyright (c) symbol.
</pre>

<p>Importantly there are also some inline elements that can be useful for 
expressing the true meaning of some words or phrases in your block-level 
paragraphs.</p>
These can be used for <em>emphasis</em>, or giving a phrase a <strong>strong <del>effect</del>
<ins>emphasis</ins></strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to these elements some symbols may also be converted for convenience
such as the copyright &copy; symbol.</p>
</div>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>Another important feature of documents is the list.  Creating lists should be apparent from the source-code.  The next level is reached by repeating the list symbol.</p>

<pre>
 * List item 1
 ** Items must have at least 1
    space before the *-symbol.
 * Clearly you can also continue the list item
onto another line if you need to.

 * A blank line will:
 *# end the list
 *# while a #-symbol will
 *## start an ordered-list
</pre>

<div class="preview">
<ul>
  <li>List item 1
    <ul>
      <li>Items must have at least 1
    space before the *-symbol.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clearly you can also continue the list item
onto another line if you need to.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A blank line will:
    <ol>
      <li>end the list</li>
      <li>while a #-symbol will
        <ol>
          <li>start an ordered-list</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Links &amp; Images</h3>

<p>Links and images are both similar by design. An opening and closing pair of symbols encloses all relevant details about the link.</p>

<pre>
A paragraph can contain a [[link:http://google.co.uk "clickable phrase"]] known 
as a hyperlink. or it could contain an image [[img:lib/icons/images.png "images"]].
</pre>

<div class="preview">
<p>A paragraph can contain a <a href="http://google.co.uk">clickable phrase</a> known 
as a hyperlink. or it could contain an image <img src="lib/icons/images.png" alt="images" title="images"/>.</p>
</div>
